## Hotdog / Not Hotdog
This notebook is a implementation of a simple CNN trained on a dataset with images of hotdogs and not-hotdogs.

## Detecting house numbers
This notebook is a implementation of a simple CNN trained on SVHN dataset. 

The goal is to:
*	1: The network is trained to be able to classify single digits.
*	2: Use the trained network as a sliding window algorithm to detect bounding boxes around digits
